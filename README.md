Portfolio Project: BETBOT

clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Ckefa/betbot.git
cd betbot

create your python environment, activate and install the specified dependancies:
python3 venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

deploy and start the app using Gunicorn wsgi:
gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:5000 -w 1 wsgi:app

configure your webserver to point to gunicorn wsgi
i.e in nginx you will do like:
proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;

The app production and Deployment completed succcessfuly;

The Story Behind BetBot's Inspiration
BetBot was ignited not by a team but by the sheer determination and passion of one—myself.

The "Eureka" Moment:
It all began with a single thought that refused to fade away - "How can I revolutionize the betting experience?" From scribbles in notebooks to late-night coding sessions, the idea evolved into BetBot.

Filling a Void:
In the vast world of betting, I saw gaps in user experience, simplicity, and innovation. BetBot, my brainchild, was designed to bridge these gaps and bring a fresh perspective to the game.

A Personal Odyssey:
BetBot isn't just a project; it's a reflection of my journey, my skills, and my dreams. This project aligns perfectly with my aspirations and talents, pushing me to new creative heights.

Week 2 - Progress and Challenges
Progress:
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the progress you’ve made this week? = 5

Explanation of your progress assessment this week:

This week, we managed to achieve the following milestones:

Created the virtual football games module which manages the schedule of teams' fixtures and simulates the results.
Developed the league table which stores the teams' results records and points, ranking the teams in the league according to their points.
What parts of your project are completed as planned?

The league simulation module, which creates fixtures and simulates the results of the week and updates the league table standings.

What aspects of your project are incomplete?

The database that maps the league table class and stores the league data for future reference of the teams' previous performances and results.

Challenges:
Technical Challenge:

During the second week of development, the most challenging technical issue we encountered was related to data synchronization and real-time updates. Implementing a system where users can place bets on ongoing virtual EPL matches presented a significant challenge.

To address this challenge, we decided to implement a combination of technologies, including WebSockets and server-side event triggers. While these technologies offered the potential for real-time communication, integrating them within our existing architecture proved complex.

Non-Technical Challenge:

During the second week of our project, the most difficult non-technical challenge we faced was managing team dynamics and communication within the development team. As the project complexity increased, so did the need for effective collaboration, timely updates, and coordinated efforts among team members.
