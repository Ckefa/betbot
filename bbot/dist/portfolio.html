    <h2>Week 2 - Progress and Challenges</h2>

    <h3>Progress:</h3>
    <p>
      <strong
        >On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the progress youâ€™ve made this
        week?</strong
      >
      = 5
    </p>
    <p><strong>Explanation of your progress assessment this week:</strong></p>
    <p>This week, we managed to achieve the following milestones:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Created the virtual football games module which manages the schedule of
        teams' fixtures and simulates the results.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developed the league table which stores the teams' results records and
        points, ranking the teams in the league according to their points.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What parts of your project are completed as planned?</strong></p>
    <p>
      The league simulation module, which creates fixtures and simulates the
      results of the week and updates the league table standings.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What aspects of your project are incomplete?</strong></p>
    <p>
      The database that maps the league table class and stores the league data
      for future reference of the teams' previous performances and results.
    </p>

    <h3>Challenges:</h3>
    <p><strong>Technical Challenge:</strong></p>
    <p>
      During the second week of development, the most challenging technical
      issue we encountered was related to data synchronization and real-time
      updates. Implementing a system where users can place bets on ongoing
      virtual EPL matches presented a significant challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
      To address this challenge, we decided to implement a combination of
      technologies, including WebSockets and server-side event triggers. While
      these technologies offered the potential for real-time communication,
      integrating them within our existing architecture proved complex.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Non-Technical Challenge:</strong></p>
    <p>
      During the second week of our project, the most difficult non-technical
      challenge we faced was managing team dynamics and communication within the
      development team. As the project complexity increased, so did the need for
      effective collaboration, timely updates, and coordinated efforts among
      team members.
